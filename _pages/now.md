    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
</div>

Updated July 22nd, 2024, from London.

I am currently living in London with my partner and going through the Entrepreneur First Grad cohort. I love London in the Summer, spring and autumn. What a wonderful place to be! For the past few years I've migrated back to New Zealand for the winter for a month or two retreat.

I have got my portable monitor stand business that is running smoothly - I make money/value while I sleep. Quite an incredible feeling!

I am excited about more ambitious projects on the horizon.

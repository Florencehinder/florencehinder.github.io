Hello, it’s me, Flo! I am an eternal optimist working to make the world a better place.

Starting with learning how to learn most effectively because I think the world could do with some more wisdom.

I’ve been an engineer, agile coach, and entrepreneur. I love when people challenge my thinking and encourage me to be better.

I am originally from Aotearoa, New Zealand, but I’ve also spent time living in the UK, France, and Madagascar (okay, only 6 weeks), but it was still formative!

I think people are good by default - unless I am proven otherwise.

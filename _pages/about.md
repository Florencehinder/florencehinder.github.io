Hello, it’s me, Flo! I am a practical optimist and serial entrepreneur working to make the world a better place one project at a time.

My 10x skill is relentless pursuit of a thing when I see the path from A to B. I can visualise shapes in my head

I love when people challenge my thinking and encourage me to be better. Since I was young I loved creating things, art, bridges & houses out of popsicle sticks or my side hustles at school. 

I've never been much of a writer but I like how it makes me think clearly and improve my communication and communication is a fundamental skill. 

I love building businesses because I see the exchange of money as a marker of value creation. There are some exceptions to this but in the most part this holds true. I enjoy creating value from 0 to 1. 

I am originally from Aotearoa, New Zealand, but I’ve also spent time living in the UK, France, and Madagascar (okay, only 6 weeks), but it was still formative and my heart lives in SF.
